Taking note on videos

# Idea
- from https://getrocketnote.com/
- purpose: note taking on video to learn programming, youtube, coursea, edx...
- tampermonkey script to inject a box, allow user to leave comment, current timestamp and the text will be automatically captured.
- store oid, user, video, source, timestamp, create date, parent oid
- can reply on same note
- will store the notes on firebase?
- do not use contenteditable to make the UI, as chinese input is not supported in chrome
- listing (backend) for viewing all notes, can filter, sort video, create time, tag
- bulk delete, tagging on notes
